# Work Day Scheduler

## Link to my page: https://simonebrin.github.io/weekday-planner/

This is a weekday scheduler that utilizes local storage to allow the user to save their daily schedule.  It also uses color-blocking to display if the hour of time on the schedule is in the past, present or future.
